# Challenge 18 - String Permutation Generation
## Description
>
Given an integer N, find the nth Fibonacci number.

## Assumptions
- assume all characters in the string are unique.

## Labels
- Dynamic Programming
- Recursion

## References
- Interview Cake

## Considerations
### Consideration 1
- building out all permutations will be expensive
- can do this recursively combined with an include not include logic
- when run out of characters, add the newly formed string to the list of strings.
